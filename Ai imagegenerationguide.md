## 🔧 Prompt Engineering Techniques Used

### **1. Character Consistency Strategy**
- Same character description across all pages in a story
- Example: "child character in striped sweatshirt" appears consistently
- Use {child_name} placeholder for personalization

### **2. Emotion Amplification**
- Every page specifies character emotions
- Examples: "laughing with joy," "determined expression," "proud smile"
- This makes images more engaging for children

### **3. Scene Staging**
- Clear foreground, mid-ground, and background
- Specific positioning: "standing beside," "holding onto," "sitting around"
- Camera angles when helpful: "looking at camera," "over shoulder"

### **4. Visual Storytelling Flow**
Each story has a visual arc:
- **Setup** → **Attempt** → **Collaboration** → **Climax** → **Resolution**

### **5. Age-Appropriate Complexity**
- **Ages 1-2:** Simple scenes, fewer objects, clear focal points
- **Ages 2-3:** More action, exaggerated expressions, humor
- **Ages 3-4:** Family dynamics, problem-solving sequences
- **Ages 4-5:** Community scenes, multiple characters, moral lessons
