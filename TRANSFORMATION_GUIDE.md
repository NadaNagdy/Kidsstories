## 💡 ADVANCED OPTIMIZATION TIPS

### For Better Character Consistency:
1. **First Image is Critical:** Get Page 1 perfect - it sets the standard
2. **Reference Previous:** After Page 1, add "same toddler character as before, now..."
3. **Save Character Seeds:** If using Midjourney, save the seed numbers
4. **Batch Generation:** Do all 5 pages in one session for memory consistency

### For Better Style Matching:
1. **Lead with Style:** Always start prompt with full style description
2. **Repeat Key Phrases:** "soft watercolor," "gentle hand-drawn," "warm pastels"
3. **Specify Paper Texture:** Mention "traditional watercolor paper grain"
4. **Avoid CGI Keywords:** Never say "3D," "rendered," "Pixar," "digital art"

### For Better Emotions:
1. **Describe the Face:** "eyes wide," "mouth open in delight," "cheeks raised"
2. **Show the Body:** "hands raised," "jumping," "leaning forward"
3. **Add Energy:** "motion lines," "sparkles," "heart shapes"
4. **Name the Feeling:** "joyful," "excited," "peaceful," "triumphant"

### For Better Composition:
1. **Rule of Thirds:** Place character slightly off-center
2. **Eye Level:** Camera at child's eye level for connection
3. **Background Simplicity:** One main setting element, rest fades to white
4. **Text Space:** Always leave top 20% or bottom 20% relatively clear

## ⚠️ COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### Issue: Character looks too different between pages
**Fix:** Add to start of prompt: "Same toddler character as previous image with dark brown hair and white tank top, now..."

### Issue: Style is too CGI/3D/Pixar-like
**Fix:** Emphasize at start: "Soft watercolor and colored pencil illustration, NOT 3D or CGI, hand-painted quality..."

### Issue: Background too cluttered
**Fix:** Add: "Simple clean background, fading to white at edges, minimal elements"

### Issue: Expression not clear
**Fix:** Be very specific: "Face showing [emotion] with wide eyes, raised eyebrows, open mouth smile, cheeks raised"

### Issue: Wrong age appearance
**Fix:** Specify clearly: "Toddler proportions, chubby arms and legs, baby-like features, approximately 2-3 years old"

### Issue: Colors too dark or saturated
